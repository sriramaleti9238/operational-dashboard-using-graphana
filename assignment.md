# Assignment: Implementing Operational Dashboard Using Grafana for Java Spring Boot Application

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to create an operational dashboard using Grafana to monitor and visualize the metrics of a Java Spring Boot application.

## Requirements:
1. Develop a Java Spring Boot application with sample endpoints to simulate metrics data. You can use mock data or integrate with existing endpoints to generate metrics such as request rate, response time, error rate, etc.
2. Set up Grafana and configure it to connect to your Spring Boot application as a data source.
3. Create a dashboard in Grafana to visualize the following metrics:
   - Request rate: Number of requests per minute.
   - Response time: Average response time of the requests.
   - Error rate: Percentage of requests that resulted in errors.
   - System load: CPU and memory utilization of the Spring Boot application.
   - Custom metrics: Any additional metrics that you think are relevant for monitoring the application's performance.
4. Use Grafana features such as panels, graphs, tables, and alerts to visualize and monitor the metrics.
5. Ensure that the dashboard is user-friendly, informative, and provides insights into the performance of the Spring Boot application.

## Deliverables:
1. Java Spring Boot application code with sample endpoints to generate metrics data.
2. Grafana dashboard configuration exported as JSON.
3. Documentation explaining the setup process, including how to run the Spring Boot application, configure Grafana, and import the dashboard JSON.
4. Optionally, provide a brief report or presentation summarizing your approach, challenges faced, and lessons learned during the implementation.

## Submission Guidelines:
- Submit your assignment as a zip file containing all the required deliverables.
- Ensure that your code is well-organized, documented, and follows best practices.
- Include clear instructions on how to set up and run the application and import the Grafana dashboard.
- Submit your assignment by [submission deadline].

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Completeness: Did the candidate implement all the required features and metrics in the Grafana dashboard?
- Accuracy: Are the metrics accurately calculated and visualized in the dashboard?
- Performance: Does the dashboard provide meaningful insights into the performance of the Spring Boot application?
- Creativity: Did the candidate explore additional metrics or features to enhance the dashboard's functionality?
- Documentation: Is the setup process well-documented and easy to follow?
- Code Quality: Is the Java Spring Boot application code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
